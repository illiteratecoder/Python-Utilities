# Python Utility Functions
This repository is home to my Python functions that have potential use across a wide range of different projects and scripts.

### Modules :octocat:
* **colors.py:** output stylized text in command-line (or other interface with ANSI support) with ANSI escape sequences.
* **fake_progress_bar.py:** print a progress bar that loads in a given amount of time.
* **runtime.py:** decorator to log a function's runtime.
